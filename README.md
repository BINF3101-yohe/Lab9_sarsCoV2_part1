# Lab 9 Analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome

Let's first set up our lab environment. Log into the cluster.

```bash
mkdir lab_9
cd lab_9
```
We also need to set up a few packages, as we will be using python! Yay!

```bash
module load python
pip install biopython matplotlib jupyterlab
```

A lot of things will print to screen if it is working. It may take a few minutes but we will get there.

# Part 1: Taking a smart approach and validating things in a well-known genome.

SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19, will be analyzed in this lab series through bioinformatics approaches to understand its genetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. We focus on identifying protein-coding genes within its genome, as these determine critical functions like host cell entry, replication, and immune evasion. By comparing SARS-CoV-2 genes with those of known viruses, we aim to infer functional roles and prioritize drug targets. Our methodology involves detecting open reading frames (ORFs) as candidate genes, filtering them using permutation tests to eliminate short non-functional sequences, and validating predictions through protein function classification algorithms. To ensure methodological rigor, we first test this pipeline on the well-characterized E. coli genome before applying it to SARS-CoV-2. This stepwise approach balances computational efficiency with biological relevance, streamlining the transition from gene prediction to functional annotation while minimizing false positives requiring experimental validation.

## Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli (E. Coli) is a bacteria commonly found in the human intestine. Most strains are harmless to humans, at worse, causing food poisoning and diarrhea. They can survive outside a host for only a short period of time, making it a potential indicator of fecal contamination. Over the years, E. Coli has been intensely studied and is probably one of the most well-understood organisms in existence. We've learned how to grow them in an optimal environment where they can reproduce up to once every 20 minutes. Due to their rapid growth and easy manipulation, biologists often use them to produce recombinant proteins.

Recombinant proteins are proteins that wouldn't naturally appear in that organism. For instance, we can insert genes that code for fluorescence into plants, making them glow in the dark. Or, perhaps more usefully, we can take the human gene that codes for insulin and convince E. Coli to produce insulin instead. Insulin that we can then use to treat diabetic patients. Or proteins used in cancer treatment. Or, more recently, we can insert fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into E. Coli and use that to produce COVID-19 vaccines. E. coli is a very well-studied organism, therefore, well-annotated. This means we can quickly check our work for any analysis we might perform because we have the ground truth, which biologists have spent decades meticulously gathering for us. We will examine the DNA sequence of E. coli and implement an algorithm for finding potential gene candidates. Because the ground truth is readily available, we can check how many of our ORF candidates are actual genes and how many candidates are false positives.

Every organism in NCBI has an associated unique identifier, which we can use to download various genomes and other kinds of data. The NCBI ID for E. coli is NC_000913.

First we need to initiate python. 
```bash
python
```
We are now in a python scripting environemnt. Not bash! Your bash commands will no longer work! It should looks something like this:
<img width="744" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 8 52 23â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac28adb-4065-42d5-84e2-6fa10221dc60" />



Fetch the E. coli genome from NCBI. We already learned how to do this in bash. Now we are going to learn with biopython.  It might take up-to a minute to download.

We are using the Entrez.efetch (http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec149) and SeqIO.read (http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec37) functions from biopython.

Here are two ways to 
```python
from Bio import Entrez

Entrez.email = "your.email@charlotte.edu"  # Always provide your email when using Entrez

# Fetch the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome (NC_000913)
handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id="NC_000913", rettype="gbwithparts", retmode="text")

# Read and save the genome data
with open("ecoli_genome.gb", "w") as output_file:
    output_file.write(handle.read())

handle.close()
```

```python
from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO

# Always provide your email when using Entrez
Entrez.email = "your.email@charlotte.edu"

# Specify the genome you want to download (e.g., E. coli K-12)
genome_id = "NC_000913"

# Fetch the genome
handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=genome_id, rettype="fasta", retmode="text")

# Save the FASTA file
with open(f"{genome_id}.fasta", "w") as output_file:
    output_file.write(handle.read())

handle.close()
```

To exit python and return to bash, type the folloiwng command:

```python
exit()
```

# LQ 1.a: Reading python script

What are two differences in the script above?

# LQ 1.b Understanding the output

Inspect both outputs using head. How do they differ?

# LQ 1.c 
 Determine how many base pairs are in the E.coli genome.

# LQ 1.d
Paste the command you used to determin this or explain how you got your answer.

Okay, great!!! Moving right along. We need to get set up to do some more elegant analyses like looking for open reading frames. Make some functions accessible here.

```bash
#make sure you are in your lab_9 directory
python
```

I am not going to have you WRITE any python code yourself today, but we should begin to look at what it is doing. Here, I am defining three fucntions we will use:
```bash
find_orfs()
find_all_orfs()
```
You can copy and paste all of this code directly below into the python prompt. It will create a set of functions we can access in this session.

```python

# LQ 9.2a

After analyzing the code, cosider the following as TRUE or FALSE.

The function find_all_orfs() implements find_orfs().

# LQ 9.2b

What are the differences between the two functions find_all_orfs() and find_orfs()?


That was fun, wasn't it? Okay, do not close your python terminal. Python is an object-oriented programming language. We are going to create first "object" here that will inherit the output of the functions we just created. 

```python
orfs = find_all_orfs("NC_000913.fasta")
```
It may take a second to run.
# LQ 9.2c

We made an object that inherited the output of find_all_orfs(). What did we name this object?

Let's take some time to inspect this object. If we look at the documentation, the output of find_all_orfs() should give us a "List of ORF dictionaries from all sequences in file." This is super exciting becauase we essentially are able to carry all of our wanted output in a single variable.

If you just type 
```python
orfs
```
a bunch of stuff prints to screen. 
```python
type(orfs)
```

# LQ 9.2c

What type of object is our object?

Now we are going to make an object of the first item in our object! Notice how just typing what you want and typing your object name give you the same answer.
```python
[orfs[0]]
first = [orfs[0]]
first
```
The object first inherits all of the output of our command, saving us lots of typing and enhancing our ability to scale up. Cool.

# LQ 9.2d
What does the second line in our orfs[] list look like? Find its length and submit the answer.


Okay, now we are going to clean things up a little bit. You can see the first and second ORF in our orfs[] list are very different lengths. Let's only select the ORFs longer than 300bp.

```python
#here is a cute mini for loop function for you!!! :) 
long_orfs = [orf for orf in orfs if orf['length'] >= 300]
print(f"Found {len(long_orfs)} ORFs longer than 300bp")
```

# LQ 9.3a
How many orfs are longer than 300bp?

Alter the print function slightly! 

# LQ 9.3b
How many orfs did we originally have before we trimmed?
